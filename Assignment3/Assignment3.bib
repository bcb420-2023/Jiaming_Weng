	abstract = {Aging is associated with functional decline of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as well as an increased risk of myeloid malignancies. We performed an integrative characterization of epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, including single-cell RNA sequencing, during normal human aging. Lineage−CD34+CD38− cells [HSC-enriched (HSCe)] undergo age-associated epigenetic reprogramming consisting of redistribution of DNA methylation and reductions in H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3. This reprogramming of aged HSCe globally targets developmental and cancer pathways that are comparably altered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of all ages, encompassing loss of 4,646 active enhancers, 3,091 bivalent promoters, and deregulation of several epigenetic modifiers and key hematopoietic transcription factors, such as KLF6, BCL6, and RUNX3. Notably, in vitro downregulation of KLF6 results in impaired differentiation, increased colony-forming potential, and changes in expression that recapitulate aging and leukemia signatures. Thus, age-associated epigenetic reprogramming may form a predisposing condition for the development of age-related AML.AML, which is more frequent in the elderly, is characterized by epigenetic deregulation. We demonstrate that epigenetic reprogramming of human HSCs occurs with age, affecting cancer and developmental pathways. Downregulation of genes epigenetically altered with age leads to impairment in differentiation and partially recapitulates aging phenotypes.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 983},

	abstract = {The functional potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) declines during aging, and in doing so, significantly contributes to hematopoietic pathophysiology in the elderly. To explore the relationship between age-associated HSC decline and the epigenome, we examined global DNA methylation of HSCs during ontogeny in combination with functional analysis. Although the DNA methylome is generally stable during aging, site-specific alterations of DNA methylation occur at genomic regions associated with hematopoietic lineage potential and selectively target genes expressed in downstream progenitor and effector cells. We found that age-associated HSC decline, replicative limits, and DNA methylation are largely dependent on the proliferative history of HSCs, yet appear to be telomere-length independent. Physiological aging and experimentally enforced proliferation of HSCs both led to DNA hypermethylation of genes regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our results provide evidence that epigenomic alterations of the DNA methylation landscape contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact:  mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {The maintenance of effective immunity over time is dependent on the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to sustain the pool of immunocompetent mature cells. Decline of immune competence with old age may stem from HSC defects, including reduced self-renewal potential and impaired lymphopoiesis, as suggested in murine models. To obtain further insights into aging-related alteration of hematopoiesis, we performed a comprehensive study of blood hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from older humans. In the elderly, HPCs present active oxidative phosphorylation and are pressed to enter cell cycling. However, p53-p21 and p15 cell senescence pathways, associated with telomerase activity deficiency, strong telomere attrition, and oxidative stress, are engaged, thus limiting cell cycling. Moreover, survival of old HPCs is impacted by pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. Lastly, telomerase activity deficiency and telomere length attrition of old HPCs may be passed on to progeny cells such as naive T lymphocytes, further highlighting the poor hematopoietic potential of the elderly. This pre-senescent profile is characteristic of the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting HPCs in elderly individuals and represents a major obstacle in terms of immune reconstitution and efficacy with advanced age., Human hematopoietic progenitor cells display altered functional and survival capacities and markers of cellular senescence with advanced age.},

	abstract = {The hematopoietic system has a very well-studied hierarchy with the long-term (LT) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) taking the top position. The pool of quiescent adult LT-HSCs generated during the fetal and early postnatal life acts as a reservoir to supply all the blood cells. Therefore, the maintenance of this stem cell pool is pivotal to maintaining homeostasis in hematopoietic system. It has long been known that external cues, along with the internal genetic factors influence the status of HSCs in the bone marrow (BM). Hypoxia is one such factor that regulates the vascular as well as hematopoietic ontogeny from a very early time point in development. The metabolic outcomes of a hypoxic microenvironment play important roles in functional regulation of HSCs, especially in case of adult BM HSCs. Anaerobic metabolic pathways therefore perform prominent role in meeting energy demands. Increased oxidative pathways on the other hand result in loss of stemness. Recent studies have attributed the functional differences in HSCs across different life stages to their metabolic phenotypes regulated by respective niches. Indicating thus, that various energy production pathways could play distinct role in regulating HSC function at different developmental/physiological states. Here, we review the current status of our understanding over the role that energy production pathways play in regulating HSC stemness. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(7):612–624, 2018},

        , Aging-associated remodeling of the immune system impairs its functional integrity and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from which all cells of the adaptive immune system ultimately originate, might play a crucial role in the remodeling of the aged immune system. We recently reported that aging of HSCs is, in part, driven by elevated activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 and that aged HSCs can be rejuvenated in vitro by inhibition of the elevated Cdc42 activity in aged HSCs with the pharmacological compound CASIN. To study the quality of immune systems stemming selectively from young or aged HSCs, we established a HSC transplantation model in T- and B-cell-deficient young RAG1−/− hosts. We report that both phenotypic and functional changes in the immune system on aging are primarily a consequence of changes in the function of HSCs on aging and, to a large extent, independent of the thymus, as young and aged HSCs reconstituted distinct T- and B-cell subsets in RAG1−/− hosts that mirrored young and aged immune systems. Importantly, aged HSCs treated with CASIN reestablished an immune system similar to that of young animals, and thus capable of mounting a strong immune response to vaccination. Our studies further imply that epigenetic signatures already imprinted in aged HSCs determine the transcriptional profile and function of HSC-derived T and B cells.,},

        , Aging-associated remodeling of the immune system impairs its functional integrity and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), from which all cells of the adaptive immune system ultimately originate, might play a crucial role in the remodeling of the aged immune system. We recently reported that aging of HSCs is, in part, driven by elevated activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 and that aged HSCs can be rejuvenated in vitro by inhibition of the elevated Cdc42 activity in aged HSCs with the pharmacological compound CASIN. To study the quality of immune systems stemming selectively from young or aged HSCs, we established a HSC transplantation model in T- and B-cell-deficient young RAG1−/− hosts. We report that both phenotypic and functional changes in the immune system on aging are primarily a consequence of changes in the function of HSCs on aging and, to a large extent, independent of the thymus, as young and aged HSCs reconstituted distinct T- and B-cell subsets in RAG1−/− hosts that mirrored young and aged immune systems. Importantly, aged HSCs treated with CASIN reestablished an immune system similar to that of young animals, and thus capable of mounting a strong immune response to vaccination. Our studies further imply that epigenetic signatures already imprinted in aged HSCs determine the transcriptional profile and function of HSC-derived T and B cells.,},

	abstract = {HSCs are rare cells that have the unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into cells of all hematopoietic lineages. The lack of donors and current inability to rapidly and efficiently expand HSCs are roadblocks in the development of successful cell therapies. Thus, the challenge of ex vivo human HSC expansion remains a fertile and critically important area of investigation. Here, we show that either SALL4A- or SALL4B-transduced human HSCs obtained from the mobilized peripheral blood are capable of rapid and efficient expansion ex vivo by {\textgreater}10 000-fold for both CD34+/CD38− and CD34+/CD38+ cells in the presence of appropriate cytokines. We found that these cells retained hematopoietic precursor cell immunophenotypes and morphology as well as normal in vitro or vivo potential for differentiation. The SALL4-mediated expansion was associated with enhanced stem cell engraftment and long-term repopulation capacity in vivo. Also, we demonstrated that constitutive expression of SALL4 inhibited granulocytic differentiation and permitted expansion of undifferentiated cells in 32D myeloid progenitors. Furthermore, a TAT-SALL4B fusion rapidly expanded CD34+ cells, and it is thus feasible to translate this study into the clinical setting. Our findings provide a new avenue for investigating mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal and achieving clinically significant expansion of human HSCs.},

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common and aggressive hematological malignancy. Acquisition of heterogeneous genetic aberrations and epigenetic dysregulation lead to the transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) into leukemic stem cells (LSC), which subsequently gives rise to immature blast cells and a leukemic phenotype. LSCs are responsible for disease relapse as current chemotherapeutic regimens are not able to completely eradicate these cellular sub-populations. Therefore, it is critical to improve upon the existing knowledge of LSC specific markers, which would allow for specific targeting of these cells more effectively allowing for their sustained eradication from the cellular milieu. Although significant milestones in decoding the aberrant transcriptional network of various cancers, including leukemia, have been achieved, studies on the involvement of post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTGR) in disease progression are beginning to unfold. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players in mediating PTGR and they regulate the intracellular fate of individual transcripts, from their biogenesis to RNA metabolism, via interactions with RNA binding domains (RBDs). In this study, we have used an integrative approach to systematically profile RBP expression and identify key regulatory RBPs involved in normal myeloid development and AML. We have analyzed RNA-seq datasets (GSE74246) of HSCs, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), monocytes, LSCs, and blasts. We observed that normal and leukemic cells can be distinguished on the basis of RBP expression, which is indicative of their ability to define cellular identity, similar to transcription factors. We identified that distinctly co-expressing modules of RBPs and their subclasses were enriched in hematopoietic stem/progenitor (HSPCs) and differentiated monocytes. We detected expression of DZIP3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in HSPCs, knockdown of which promotes monocytic differentiation in cell line model. We identified co-expression modules of RBP genes in LSCs and among these, distinct modules of RBP genes with high and low expression. The expression of several AML-specific RBPs were also validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Network analysis identified densely connected hubs of ribosomal RBP genes (rRBPs) with low expression in LSCs, suggesting the dependency of LSCs on altered ribosome dynamics. In conclusion, our systematic analysis elucidates the RBP transcriptomic landscape in normal and malignant myelopoiesis, and highlights the functional consequences that may result from perturbation of RBP gene expression in these cellular landscapes.},
